Not all logs hold the same value, and prioritising what to ingest first helps ensure visibility over the most important systems, supports compliance, and manages costs effectively.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Focus on high-risk, high-value and fast rotating logs that provide     early visibility into security events. These include firewall deny     logs, VPN activity, and intrusion alerts, which offer critical     insight into potential threats and are often lost quickly if not     collected in real time. Prioritising these logs supports effective     threat detection and compliance without unnecessary cost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begin with default security logs, especially those that cover     authentication, usage of privileged accounts, and endpoint alerts.     These are key for both real-time monitoring and investigation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prioritise native connectors like Azure Activity for Azure     operations, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for user login tracking,     Microsoft 365 Defender for threat alerts, and Defender for Endpoint     for device protection, as these provide critical security insights     with minimal or no cost.</p> </li> <li> <p>Include additional sources like firewalls network alerts, VPN logs     for remote access visibility and system logs from both Windows and     Linux servers, whether hosted in Azure or on-premises. For Windows,     prioritise Security event logs (e.g. logon attempts, group changes).     For Linux, focus on logs relevant to authentication and access     control, such as auth.log and SSH login events. Consider logs from     third-party security tools and network virtual appliances (NVAs).     When including system logs, make sure to separate security-relevant     data from general performance or operational logs to avoid     unnecessary ingestion</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider high-value third-party logs that can improve visibility and     support deeper investigations, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Email security gateway logs (e.g. Defender for Office 365, Proofpoint)</p> </li> <li> <p>Web proxy or filtering logs</p> </li> <li> <p>NetFlow data for network traffic analysis</p> </li> <li> <p>DNS query logs for identifying access to malicious domains</p> </li> <li> <p>Application security logs from web application firewalls</p> </li> </ul> <p>These logs are especially useful when looking into phishing attempts, data exfiltration, or lateral movement. However, depending on the solution in use, custom integration might be needed to bring them into Microsoft Sentinel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prioritise Azure AD sign-in logs and high-value Windows event logs     such as Event IDs 4624 (successful logon), 4625 (failed logon), and     4672 (privileged logon) for user monitoring and Syslog high-severity     alerts for threat detection, while avoiding system performance logs     with low security value. Using Sentinel's data connectors and Data     Collection Rules (DCR), this targeted approach ensures only     high-priority logs are collected, supporting security analytics,     compliance and cost savings by excluding unnecessary data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid collecting operational logs that are only for system health or     performance, as these can increase costs and fill your workspace.     Examples include Windows logs like System or Application, and Linux     logs such as /var/log/syslog, which mainly record routine service     status messages.

Sentinel can ingest these logs through native connectors     like Azure Activity, Microsoft Entra ID, and resource-specific     diagnostic settings.

Move older logs to long-term retention or   Archive tier for long-term, low-cost storage, such as retaining   CommonSecurityLog for up to 1 year for historical analysis.

These options support compliance, cost efficiency, and the operational needs of security teams. By understanding the different retention policies available, organisations can configure Sentinel to store logs in a way that balances cost, performance, and regulatory requirements. Below are the retention options provided by Microsoft Sentinel:</p> <p>Default retention: By default, logs are retained for 30 days in the Log Analytics workspace. This period ensures that security teams have access to recent data for real-time threat detection and incident response.</p> <p>90 days free retention: Microsoft Sentinel offers 90 days of free retention for data stored in the Log Analytics workspace. By default, the Usage and Azure Activity tables keep data for at least 90 days at no charge. When you increase the workspace retention to more than 90 days, you also increase the retention of these tables. These tables are also free from data ingestion charges.</p> <p>Extended retention: For organisations needing to retain logs for longer periods (beyond the default 30 days), Sentinel allows extended retention options. Extended retention can be configured in increments up to 730 days (2 years). This is essential for compliance with regulations that require storing data for longer durations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or other industry-specific standards.</p> <p>Custom retention policies: Sentinel also supports the creation of custom retention policies that allow organisations to fine-tune their log retention based on data types, such as security logs, operational logs, or compliance-related logs. Custom retention settings can be applied across different data sources, ensuring that logs critical to security and compliance are retained for longer periods, while others may be deleted sooner.</p> <p>Archive retention: For even longer-term retention, Sentinel offers the option to archive data. Archived logs are stored in a lower-cost storage tier, and although they remain available for querying, accessing archived data incurs additional costs. Archiving is ideal for organisations that need to comply with retention regulations but do not require frequent access to older logs.</p> <p>Retention for regulatory compliance: For certain industries, Sentinel allows for the configuration of retention policies specifically designed to meet regulatory requirements. Compliance-driven retention ensures that organisations can demonstrate adherence to industry standards while minimising unnecessary storage costs.</p> <p>Data retention: Logs that exceed the retention policy are automatically deleted, reducing the storage footprint and ensuring that only relevant and compliant data is stored. Organisations can also configure data deletion to happen manually or after a certain retention period expires, offering flexibility in how data is managed.</p>"},{"location":"best-practices/sentinel/#appendix-knowledge-base","title":"Appendix: Knowledge base","text":"<p>Microsoft has explained the Sentinel related log management in more detail.</p> Topic Purpose Best practices for data collection in Microsoft Sentinel Microsoft data collection practices.
